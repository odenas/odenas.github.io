Barber: What about [Barnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Barnard)?

Ballard: I think he became show business afterwards. That was where science created its first superstar, the moment [Washkansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Washkansky) had his new heart, the first, one, that was something unique. I’m sure that most scientific developments in the future are going to be made in the Barnard way. There’ll be no more of the absent-minded professor in his laboratory stumbling on penicillin and taking five years to develop it. No, he’ll be a pushy, ambitious, publicity-oriented scientist who will launch himself not just into the new discovery, but into show business at the same time.
