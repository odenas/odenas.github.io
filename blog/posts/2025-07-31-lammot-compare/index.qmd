# Lammot Compare

In "Bird by Bird," Anne Lamott warns against "comparing your inside to other people's outside." 8 words to capture the fundamental asymmetry in how people evaluate themselves relative to others.

The comparison trap operates on incomplete information. One has access to their own internal struggles, doubts, and failures, while observing only the curated external presentations of others. Social comparison serves as a reference point for gauging progress and finding one's place in the world, but it relies on fundamentally unequal data sets. The result is comparing one's rough draft to another's published work.

Comparison can stem from legitimate curiosity about how others think, work, and solve problems. This form of comparison remains healthy when focused on process and learning. It becomes toxic when the focus shifts from "how do they do that?" to "why can't I be like them?" Healthy comparison expands possibilities; toxic comparison diminishes self-worth. The latter often leads to rumination - repetitive mental loops that transform momentary observations into extended periods of self-criticism.
