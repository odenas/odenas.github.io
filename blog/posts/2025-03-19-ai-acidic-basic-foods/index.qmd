> Give examples of alkaline and acidic foods.

It's important to understand that the concept of "alkaline" and "acidic" foods refers to the effect they have on your body *after* digestion, not their inherent pH. Here's a breakdown with examples:

**Alkaline Foods**

These foods are thought to leave alkaline "ash" in the body after digestion. They are generally rich in minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

*   **Vegetables:** Most vegetables are alkaline, especially:
    *   Leafy greens (spinach, kale, lettuce)
    *   Root vegetables (beets, carrots, sweet potatoes)
    *   Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)
    *   Others (cucumber, celery, peppers)
*   **Fruits:** Most fruits are also alkaline, particularly:
    *   Berries
    *   Citrus fruits (lemons, limes, oranges - despite being acidic before digestion)
    *   Melons
    *   Avocados
*   **Nuts and Seeds:** Some nuts and seeds are alkaline, including:
    *   Almonds
    *   Pumpkin seeds
*   **Legumes:**
    *   Lentils
    *   Beans (kidney beans, lima beans)

**Acidic Foods**

These foods are thought to leave acidic "ash" in the body after digestion. They often contain higher levels of protein, phosphate, and sulfur.

*   **Meat and Poultry:**
    *   Beef
    *   Pork
    *   Chicken
    *   Turkey
*   **Fish and Seafood**
*   **Dairy:**
    *   Milk
    *   Cheese
    *   Yogurt
*   **Eggs**
*   **Grains:**
    *   Wheat
    *   Rice
    *   Corn
*   **Processed Foods:** Many processed foods, including packaged snacks and convenience foods, tend to be acidic.
*   **Alcohol and Caffeine**

**Important Notes:**

*   **The pH scale:** The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are alkaline.
*   **Body pH regulation:** Your body has sophisticated mechanisms to maintain a stable pH level in your blood, regardless of your diet. While the alkaline diet is a popular concept, there's limited scientific evidence to support many of its claimed health benefits.
*   **Overall diet:** Focusing on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is more important than strictly adhering to an alkaline or acidic food list.

If you have specific health concerns or are considering making significant dietary changes, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian.
