    "text": "“In addition, Rome (if one has not yet been acquainted with it) makes one feel stifled with sadness for the first few days: through the gloomy and lifeless museum-atmosphere that it exhales, through the abundance of its pasts, which are brought forth and laboriously held up (pasts on which a tiny present subsists), through the terrible overvaluing, sustained by scholars and philologists and imitated by the ordinary tourist in Italy, of all these disfigured and decaying Things, which, after all, are essentially nothing more than than accidental remains from another time and from another life that is not and should not be ours. Finally, after weeks of daily resistance, one finds oneself somewhat composed again, even though still a bit confused, and one says to oneself: No, there is not more beauty here than in other places, and all these objects that have been marveled at by generation after generation, mended and restored by the hands of workmen, mean nothing, are nothing, and have no heart and no value; — but there is much beauty here, because everywhere there is much beauty. Waters infinitely full of life move along the ancient aqueducts into the great city and dance in the many city squares over white basins of stone and spread out in large, spacious pools and murmur by day and lift up the murmuring to the night, which is vast here and starry and soft with winds. And there are gardens here, unforgettable boulevards, and staircases designed by Michelangelo, staircases constructed on the pattern of downward-gliding waters and, as they descend, widely giving birth to step out of step as if it were wave out of wave. Through such impressions one gathers oneself, wins oneself back from the exacting multiplicity, which speaks and chatters there (and how talkative it is!), and one slowly learns to recognize very few Things in which something eternal endures that one can love and something solitary that one can gently take part in.”"

That was where science created its first superstar, the moment Washkansky had his new heart, the first, one, that was something unique. I’m sure that most scientific developments in the future are going to be made in the Barnard way. There’ll be no more of the absent-minded professor in his laboratory stumbling on penicillin and taking five years to develop it. No, he’ll be a pushy, ambitious, publicity-oriented scientist who will launch himself not just into the new discovery, but into show business at the same time.\n1970: Lynn Barber interviewing John Ballard.

    "title": "Is Kill Bill a feminist movie?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Ihave seen only pieces of the movie, one scene in particular made me notice the huge war of sexes with a clear winner: female.\nOne example is scene where The Bride (Uma Thurman) is about to fight the aides of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and others. Just before the slaughter starts, O-Ren Ishii tells the owner of the club to run away (because things are about to get dirty). The guy shits his pants and runs away. What about his wife standing next to him? She remains. It seems like a stupid detail, but it got me thinking and I came up with the following interpretation: the owner of the restaurant, a servile coward man, cannot stand the cruelty of what is about to happen, but his wife can. Just minutes ago, the wife would call him to stand for his honor in front of absurd requests of O-Ren Ishii and her gang.\nThese parallelisms go on and on: minutes before the slaughter, O-Ren Ishii humiliates a man sitting in their table; At the same night, The Bride is about to kill hundreds of young Japanese man …\nIt kind of makes sense in broader terms too. There are three male types (i) bad guys samurai soldiers on suits and ties whose limbs are being chopped off like cattle and are being humiliated by a blonde american girl in their very own weapon: the sword. (ii) kung fu masters and sword makers and the like who are amazed by the super-abilities and determination of The Bride and swear fidelity and eternal friendship to her. (iii) Bill, a rat capable of very low actions betrayal etc. On the other hand, there is only one female type (some are good some bad, it doesn’t matter): badass females. When they kill, it is for high motivations or to defend their honor in such a masculine society."

    "text": "My last post on Pirandello’s “The late Mattia Pascal” is an excerpt from his reply to the criticism that the book was fantastic and far from life – real life. Alas, all of the pleasure of reading the reply in Italian will be lost as I try to translate it.\n“… Real life has the priceless privilege that despite the multitude of its absurdities, small and big, it doesn’t have to look real. Art, on the other hand, feels a strong need to look real. [According to critics.]\nThe absurdities of life have no need to look real, because they are real. On the contrary, to be credible, the absurdities of art, need to look real. But then, looking real, they are not absurdities any more.\nA real life event can be absurd; art, to be [real] art, cannot.\nIf follows that lacking absurdity and fantastic, in the name of reality, art is a banality.\nBanality in the name of art, not in the name of life. “"

    "text": "In a lecture at Emory, Umberto Eco said (roughly) on truth in fiction:\nthe statement “‘Superman is Clark Kent’ can never be challenged” whether the statement “‘Hitler died at a Berlin bunker’” is only (very) highly probable.\nsome thought on this seemingly semantic game leads to a number of important services of fiction to our life. One of them is, one can argue, the definition and expression of human qualities. I doubt non-fiction, often no more than an enumeration of ‘(very) highly probable’ facts along with inaccuracies introduced by the choice of words, is as appropriate.\nHow can one learn about qualities like introversion, compassion, loneliness, irrationality from non-fiction?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you noticed how one of the first things of which you start thinking when you talk abut events and their probability, are the Venn diagrams. However, when it comes to independence, Venn diagrams are really inappropriate.\nFirst, you cannot eye-spot two independent events in a Venn diagram, since you would have to recognize that the ratios are perfectly right (with circles in a blackboard this is quite hard).\nSecond, given that the words “independent” and “disjoint” are somewhat similar in real life, one might be tempted to see two disjoint circles in a Venn diagram as independent. Well, they are deterministically dependent.\nIf you draw squares, things become a little easier. Imagine four squares meeting at a vertex, with event A being the two left ones, and event B the two bottom ones. P(A) = P(A|B) = 1/2 so A and B are independent.\nCan you go up to three? Almost. You can extend the above picture to three, but pairwise independent events, by letting event C occupy the upper left and the bottom right. Can you draw three independent (in the strict sense) events? I gave up 🙂\nNow, are Venn diagrams really bad at independent events, or they are they really good? By ‘good’ I mean that they are just saying to us that independent events, in nature, are in some sort of exceptional equilibrium. Thus, it should be as hard to draw them as they are rare in nature."

Perche’?” fece lei, notando evidentemente il mio curioso imbarazzo e ridendo questa volta come un vera bambina.\nRisi anch’io e soggiunsi:\n“E allora, se non le dispiace mi chiamo Adriano Meis: ecco fatto! Potrei alloggiare qua stasera stessa? O tornero’ meglio domattina…”\nElla mi rispose: “Come vuole”, ma io me ne andai con l’impressione che le avrei fatto un gran piacere se non fossi piu’ tornato.

Mein Herr: That’s another thing we’ve learned from your nation, map-making. But we’ve carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful? Myself: About: six inches to the mile Mein Herr: Only six inches! We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile! Myself: Have you used it much? Mein Herr: It has never been spread out, yet: the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well”\nIt was a nice surprise to me because sometime earlier I had read a keynote paper on maximal words (maximality is a technical concept in data mining) and how they are a useful compact representation of big data. The analogy was taken from J.L. Borges’s “Viajes de Varones Prudentes”:\n“… in that Empire, the craft of Cartography attained such perfection that the map of a single province covered the space of an entire City, and the map of an Empire itself an entire Province. In the course of time, these extensive maps were found somewhat wanting, and so the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was the same scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point for point.”\nThese passages seem so similar."

The Fancy as nearly creates as the imagination, and neither at all. Novel conceptions are merely unusual combinations. The mind of man can imagine nothing which does not exist: — if it could, it would create not only ideally, but substantially — as do the thoughts of God.\n[…]\nThe fact seems to be that Imagination, Fancy, Fantasy, and humor, have in common the elements, Combination, and Novelty.\n[…]\nFantasy seeks not merely disproportionate but incongruous or antagonistical elements, the effect is rendered more pleasurable from its greater positiveness; — there is a merry effort of Truth to shake from her that which is no property of hers; — and we laugh outright in recognizing Humor.\n[…]\nbut when either Fancy or Humor is expressed to gain an end — is pointed at a purpose — whenever either becomes objective in place of subjective — then it he comes, also, pure Wit or Sarcasm, just as the purpose is well-intentioned or malevolent."

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Trust me I’m lying”, by Ryan Holiday, is an overview of the (display) advertisement ecosystem. It explains the trickery used to catch the attention of the viewer-buyer. The author himself writes to be a master of these tricks. He has used them also to catch the attention of large groups of people. The book lays down a simple equation: the writers write, photographers publish pictures and media outlets publish to buy your attention and sell it to advertisers.\n“The ways of seeing”, by John Berger, is a different description. It describes the relationship between display advertisement and painting. It characterizes the paintings on which display advertisement takes pictorial and symbolical inspiration.\n\n\n\nSimilarities between painting and display ads. (1/2) “Ways of seeing” J. Berger\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities between painting and display ads. (2/2) “Ways of seeing” J. Berger\n\n\nWhy is advertisement credible and successful? John Berger says:\n“Publicity speaks in the future tense and yet the achievement of this future is endlessly deferred. How then does publicity remain credible – or credible enough to exert the influence it does? It remains credible because the truthfulness of publicity is judged, not by the real fulfillment of its promises, but by the relevance of its fantasies to those of the spectator-buyer. Its essential application is not to reality but to day-dreams.”\nand\n“The gap between what publicity actually offers and the future it promises, corresponds with the gap between what the spectator-buyer feels himself to be and what he would like to be. The two gaps become one; and instead of the single gap being bridged by action or lived experience, it is filled with glamorous day-dreams.”\nall this flourishes in the current social and political environment\n“The industrial society which has moved towards democracy and then stopped half way is the ideal society for generating such an emotion. The pursuit of individual happiness has been acknowledged as a universal right. Yet the existing social conditions make the individual feel powerless. He lives in the contradiction between what he is and what he would like to be. Either he then becomes fully conscious of the contradiction and its causes, and so joins the political struggle for a full democracy which entails, amongst other things, the overthrow of capitalism; or else he lives, continually subject to an envy which, compounded with his sense of powerlessness, dissolves into recurrent day-dreams.”"

    "text": "Among other things “Stolen Focus” by J. Hari discusses a really interesting question on social media regulation.\nThe tobacco side of the argument is this. Social media platforms are businesses that make money on their user’s (i.e., people browsing the content and posting it, not the advertisers) attention. It turns out it is not very healthy for us users. Furthermore, us users, even the best of us, cannot do anything to fight these platforms from stealing our focus — they have been designed and built by some of the smartest engineers and psychologists out there, and they are now an integral part of our daily lives. So, like tobacco, let’s regulate and wait for the world distraction index (I made this up), like the lung cancer rates to go down.\nThe ice-cream argument goes like this. First of all, it is not true that we are powerless agains these platforms. With some exceptions, we can use them responsibly. Regulation is likely to be less effective (Likely the outcome GDPR has trained people to click “Accept all cookies”) than the industry adapting to the landscape. This argument, rings all kinds of alarm bells on my head — think of car emissions, environmental goals set by businesses etc. — but this is different, since attention is such a core part of the business model for these platforms (unlike the air quality for car companies). If they don’t adapt their users will leave.\nI partly agree with both arguments. It is impossible to live without social media, but one can choose how to use them. This might be more for some than for others (kids), which is where regulation might be needed. If you read the book, definitely check out the raw audio interview with Nir Eyal on the book website."
